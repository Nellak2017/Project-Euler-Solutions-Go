# Project-Euler-Solutions
---
I am a hobbyist that loves to solve programming puzzles, I have made efficient Go code to solve many Project Euler Problems.
I have made this project to help understand the Go language and to solve the Project Euler Problems in a more efficient way.

Every program was written from scratch, and the only libraries used are the ones that were hand crafted. If there is a mathematical shortcut for a problem, it will be in the comments to justify the solution.
